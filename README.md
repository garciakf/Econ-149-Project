# Econ-149-Project
Purpose of this Project (Project Overview)
This project aims to track and analyze the trends of nominal GDP growth alongside income growth, inflation, and the rise of housing costs. The goal of this project is to illustrate growing disparities between the size of the economy and the wealth of the average American, as reflected in many political and economic statements.

Structure of the Project Report
We anticipate that the project will have four sections: nominal GDP growth by year, inflation rate by year, median income growth rate per year, and cost of housing growth rate per year. The project will then have a cumulative chart showing all the trends together. As mentioned in the purpose, the project seeks to create a visualization of the aforementioned trends. Growth or decline will be indicated in percentage change from the previous year.

Overview of the Data
For this project, we will be using data primarily from BEA, BLS, FRED, TradingEconomics, and Statista.
Though the information provided by each source will mostly be the same, we are using multiple sources for the same information in order to ensure we are inputting the correct data.
